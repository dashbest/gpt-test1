## Playing rock-paper-scissors in the browser console

The `janken.js` script provides a simple じゃんけん game you can run directly in a
Chrome (or any modern) browser.

1. Open a blank tab and launch the developer tools console.
2. Copy the entire contents of `janken.js` and paste it into the console.
3. Run `playJanken()` to start the game. Input can be `グー/チョキ/パー` or
   `rock/scissors/paper`, and you can play multiple rounds until you cancel.
